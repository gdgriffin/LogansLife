	<p>Welcome to my page! Hi my names Logan and I'm a Shih Tzu. I was born in Houston, Texas on January 15, 2012 which makes me six years old. I flew to Boston during April of 2012 when I was greeted by my soon to be amazing family at Logan Airport. My family hadn't decided on a name prior to meeting me, so it just happened that I was named after the airport. I grew up about 25 minutes North of Boston. I have two amazing parents and an older brother and sister. I must admit that I'm closest with my sister, she is my best friend and I adore her so much.
