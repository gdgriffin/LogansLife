	<p> I don't travel very far, but my family has a lake house on Long Lake in Harrison Maine which is the best place to visit every weekend in the summer. My family actually decided to make my middle name Harrison after the town where our house is in. I love going on the boat even though I'm so small I have to wear a life jacket and I get very hot because of it. I've never been on the jetski before because my family says its unsafe for me. I don't like to swim very much but when it's hot out I will go in the water in my life jacket only if my sister is holding me. I also enjoy going down to the board walk in Naples on the boat to get ice cream or lucnh with my family. I always get so much attention from everybody else that's downtown as well so that's obviously one of my favorite parts.
