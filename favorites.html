	<p> My "favorites" mainly consist of snacks. I LOVE cookies and string cheese, I might have a slight obsession! I sit and stare at the counter where I know my family keeps my treats. If nobody notices that I am waiting for a snack I start to cry and sometimes if I get ignored long enough I'll even start to bark. Eventually someone gives into my cravings because they get annoyed of listening to me. But, the one thing that I adore more than cookies, is string cheese. Everytime I hear the drawer in the fridge open I immediatley run into the kitchen and wait for my mom or sister to give me a piece (my brother and dad hate cheese). I usually cry or bark until I get fed a piece or two. I guess you could say that I am a spoiled and I know how to get my way, but I am also very smart!
